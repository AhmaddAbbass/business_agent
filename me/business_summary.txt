KolmoLabs — Summary

Mission:
Make advanced AI useful, affordable, and verifiable for SMBs in MENA using Kolmogorov Neural Networks (KNNs) with strong guardrails.

Services:
- KNN agents for operations (email triage, CRM updates, spreadsheets)
- Document Q&A with KNN+RAG over PDFs/wikis/tickets
- Analytics + alerts (explainable anomaly detection)
- Custom action tools (MCP-style) with logs, retries, and safety stops

Team:
- Mohammad Lakkis — Co-founder & CTO (KNN whisperer, calm GPUs)
- (Rumored) Hidden Boss: Prof. Ammar Mohanna — appears when demos need one more feature and evaluation

Unique Value Proposition:
Structure-first KNN design; built-in evaluator loops and cost caps; fast, frugal deployments.
